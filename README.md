# AWS Subscription Project

## Description

This is designed as a way for me to keep track of all my subscriptions **reliably** before a company takes money from my account.

The code that I used for my AWS introductory project

- This includes...
  - The CLI I built to interact with the Dynamo database
  - The code invoked by the AWS Lambda function I have in production
